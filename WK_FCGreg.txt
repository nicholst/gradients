Features to add...
  - Base atlas only on a*100% of closest subjects 
  - Allow switching between different methods (instead doing all
  - Iterative update of atlas


NEW IDEA to impliment
  - Do full affine registration to get *sharpest* possible atlas
     - Maybe here it is key to use only closest subjects to avoid
       insane xforms
     - Then figure out how to back off perspective
     - Or simply define this new atlas and then register with rot+scale and back-off scale


3D - Homog. xform has
 - 3 shift
 - 3x3 rot w/ 3 rot, 3 scal
 - 3 perspective

"12 parameter affine" - parallel lines stay parallel, shift, rot, scale
"15 parameter affine" - strait lines stay strait
